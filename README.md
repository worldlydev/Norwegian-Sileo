# WorldlyDev's Norwegian Sileo Translations
My Norwegian Bokmål and Nynorsk translations for Sileo.

## WIP
This project is a work in progress but is being abandoned for the time being. The Norwegian Bokmål localizations have been sent in to the Sileo team and may be included if they choose to.

If Sileo is open-sourced I will update the Bokmål strings and release my finished Nynorsk strings. Atm it is just not worth it to translate strings individually in Filza when Github Desktop and Crowdin are available for other projects. 

## Archived
This project is archived for the time being. Feel free to fork this project and update my strings or reach out to me if Sileo open-sources.
